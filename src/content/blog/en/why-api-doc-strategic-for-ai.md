## Documentation: a Strategic Lever

In the AI ecosystem, API documentation goes far beyond listing endpoints.  
It must guide **developers, data scientists, and compliance teams** through complex challenges: security, transparency, and alignment with the European **AI Act**.

## Three Key Roles

1. **Faster Onboarding** – shorten the time for teams to test and adopt an API.  
2. **Trust** – provide clear guides and traceability to inspire credibility.  
3. **Compliance** – embed legal requirements (risks, limitations, ethics) directly into the documentation.  

## Conclusion

Well-crafted documentation is a **competitive advantage**: it showcases not only product quality but also the seriousness of the organization.
